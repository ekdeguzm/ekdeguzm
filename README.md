## Hi, I'm Emil!  ðŸ‘‹

My journey began when I learned a bit of code to improve data analysis for an estuarine ecology research project. What started as a curiosity turned into a fascination for programming.

In 2022, I received a grant to join the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, a selective, self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers. There, I created web apps, collaborated with other engineers, and studied <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">foundational computer science</a>. 

<!-- where I took collaborated with others to craft mere ideas into realities on the internet. In the past four years since graduating, I also worked, volunteered, and studied in four different countries as a forester, restoration biological scientist, science educator, and fisheries researcher.  -->

Outside of programming, I love to go on adventures outside, run, create <a href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/artist/4d1LMfa1HX0vBHO0o1B6jE?si=22qea_8PSJuy-YJ1_ZPpdg">music</a>, and learn languages. In 2023, I spent 10 months in Taiwan gaining fluency in Mandarin.

Whether you want to talk software development, traveling, or just want to say hi â€” Iâ€™m always open to new opportunities and connections. Let's chat!
